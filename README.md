# 🎨 Spirograph Generator with Python Turtle

This Python project draws a **colorful spirograph** using the `turtle` graphics module and the `random` module. By drawing circles with incremental headings and randomly generated colors, it creates mesmerizing geometric art.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Draws a spirograph using 100 overlapping circles
- Each circle rotates 5° from the previous one (`setheading(i)`)
- Random RGB color generation for vibrant visuals
- Smooth and fast rendering with `speed("fastest")`

---

## 📁 Code Structure

```python
- random_color(): Function to generate a random RGB color
- for loop: Iterates 100 times to draw colored circles
- tim.setheading(i): Rotates each circle to form the spirograph
🧠 What You'll Learn
Using turtle for shape-based drawing

RGB color mode with colormode(255)

setheading() for directional control

Working with loops and procedural design

🛠 Requirements
Python 3 and higher

Standard Library only (no external dependencies)

▶️ How It Works
1. Sets up a Turtle with pen size and speed
2. Generates a random color each iteration
3. Draws a circle with radius 100
4. Rotates by 5 degrees and repeats
